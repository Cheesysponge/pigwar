  <h1>Instructions</h1>
  <div id = box>
  <p> 
      Evil pigs are trying to steal some cake and you have been hired to stop them.
  </p>
  <p>
    You and your army of controlled machines must pop the pigs and stop the pigs from getting to the cake for as long as possible.
  </p>
  <p>
    For every pig you stop you will be rewarded money which you can spend on upgrades.
  </p>
  <p>
    Over time, the pigs will get stronger, faster, and smarter.
  </p>
  <p>
    You have three different defenses to protect the cake from the pigs
  </p>
  <p>
    On the left you have a robot which can place snowball shooters and rock throwers which shoot in a straight line from left to right.
  </p>
  <p>
    On the top you have a robot which can place anvil droppers and sonic beam shooters.
  </p>
  <p>
    You also have a magical pearl which can go anywhere on the map, place portals, crystals, and more.
  </p>
  <p>
    Certain things like helmet pigs and stone blocks can only be broken using a certain type of machine.
